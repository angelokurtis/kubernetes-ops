                                The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                                the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                                DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                                in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                                also be an IP address.

                                Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                                risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                                which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                                webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                                to turn up in a new cluster.

                                The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

                                A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                                a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                                webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

                                Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
                                allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not
                                allowed, either.

                                The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                                the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                                DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                                in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                                also be an IP address.

                                Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is

                                webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                                to turn up in a new cluster.

                                The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

                                A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                                a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                                webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

                                                  a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell.
                                                  Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

                                          RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                          This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                          For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                          the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                          Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                          this init container will be continually restarted on
                                          exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                          containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                          will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                          is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                          container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                          for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                          init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                          completed.

                                                  a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell.

                                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                      user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or

                                              preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                              container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                              container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                                When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified
                                                (which defaults to None).

                                                RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                                recursively.

                                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                                recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                                recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                                field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is

                                                an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                                If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                                None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                                If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                    Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                    init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                    to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                    unique among all containers.
                                    Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                    The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                    by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                    that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                    in a similar fashion.
                                    Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                              container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                          This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                          For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                          the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                          Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                          this init container will be continually restarted on
                                          exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                          containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                          will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                          is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                          container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                          for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                          init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                          completed.

                                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                                recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                                field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is

                                                an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                                If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to

                                        seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                        It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                        Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                        "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                        This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                        "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                        This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                        It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                        Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                        whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                        CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                        "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                        and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                        This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                        All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                          to topologies that satisfy it.

                                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                              Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system.
                                              Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                          and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                          Use this if:
                                          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                             tracking are needed,
                                          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                             information on the connection between this volume type
                                             and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                          of an individual pod.

                                          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                          more information.

                                          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                          persistent volumes at the same time.

                                              The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                              owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                              pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                              `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                              entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                              is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                              An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                              will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                              volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                              the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                              meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an

                                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                        specified.
                                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                        in any namespaces.
                                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                          image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                          The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                          - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                          - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                          - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                          The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                          A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                          The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                          The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                          The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                          Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                          The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                              Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                              IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                              Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                           cluster in the cloud provider API. Not used by the `generic`
                           provider. Required when one of `address` or `ca.crt` is not set.
                        - `address`: the address of the Kubernetes API server. Required
                           for `generic`. For the other providers, if not specified, the
                           first address in the cluster resource will be used, and if
                           specified, it must match one of the addresses in the cluster
                           resource.
                           If audiences is not set, will be used as the audience for the
                           `generic` provider.
                        - `ca.crt`: the optional PEM-encoded CA certificate for the
                           Kubernetes API server. If not set, the controller will use the
                           CA certificate from the cluster resource.
                        - `audiences`: the optional audiences as a list of
                           line-break-separated strings for the Kubernetes ServiceAccount
                           token. Defaults to the `address` for the `generic` provider, or

                           ServiceAccount in the same namespace that should be used
                           for authentication. If not specified, the controller

                                must be specified.

                                The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                                the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                                DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                                in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                                also be an IP address.

                                Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                                risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                                which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                                webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                                to turn up in a new cluster.

                                The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

                                A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                                a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                                webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

                                Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
                                allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not
                                allowed, either.

                            the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this list
                            are supported by API server, conversion will fail for the custom resource.
                            If a persisted Webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not
                            include any versions known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail.

                    THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                    through a Crossplane feature flag.
                    ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                    take on the managed and external resources.
                    This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                    release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                    values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                    custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
                    See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223
